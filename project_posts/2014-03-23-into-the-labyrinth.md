Into the Labyrinth
==================

Only five days to finish this project, five days before the Minotaurs strikes.
This time I can't afford to get lost. I don't know where this will lead me.
All I know is, that in the end I want to have a continuous, spacefilling curve.
One that goes from start to finish, without interruption.
Like Ariadne's thread, but way, way longer.

Maybe this little [Meandroid](https://github.com/craftoid/devart-template/blob/master/project_posts/2014-03-23-inspiration.md#meandroid) can serve me as a Talisman...


### Storming the Brain ###

Here are some of the ideas that I want to play with while finding my way through the maze

##### Code Crafting ####

Creating little toy languages for computational craft. Languages for embroidery.
Maybe also languages for other crafts such as knitting, weaving or beading.

##### Space Filling #####

I want my curve to *FILL ALL THE SPACE !!!*  
Mabye I should use space-filling sub units that can be filled in by other artists?
That would be great. Amazon Mechanical Turk comes to mind...

##### Mazing and Friezing #####

I love the convoluted paths of mazes.
I started doodling fractal versions of meanders.
It turned out to be a bit tricky. But I know there's a Meander-Fractal out there.
And it's going to bear my name, if only I make it out of this maze alive.

##### Sewing and Stitching #####

Right now there's a fantastic Kickstarter project online. It's called Embroidermodder.
It's an opensource embroidery project that comes with a libarary that supports basically every embroidery format out there. 

This might be a great time to wrap this up into a library for OpenFrameworks, or just pick out the parts I need, and turn them into a tiny Processing library.
This might be the way to go since I'm more fluent with Processing.

##### Coding and Recoding #####

I'm currently very fasciated with quines, but also with files that can be interpreted as Images, PDFs, and ZIPs alike. (If you haven't encountered it yet, I highly recommend you google for POCorGTFO)

Maybe I could take this approach to the textile domain, adding multiple layers of code and interpretation. I don't think I have the hacker skills to do this within the time that remains, but maybe I can still conjure up some one to join in the project?
