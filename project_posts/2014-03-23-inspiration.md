I stumbled upon it when browsing a page about [Colony Formation](http://coral.aims.gov.au/info/structure-colony.jsp)
Looks like it's a part of stony coral known as [Platygyra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platygyra):

Those corals form little labyrinths in their own right.
They also look very much like some kind of Turing patterns.
