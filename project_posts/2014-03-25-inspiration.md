## Code Crafting ##

**Let's encode information into the meandering thread!**

The basic idea of code crafting is that textile structures can serve as an information storage. 
Popular examples of Code Crafting inculde Khipu ([Code Knotting](http://www.k2g2.org/wiki:code_knotting)) and [Code Weaving](http://www.k2g2.org/wiki:code_weaving).

#### LOGO Turtles ####

Seymour Papert and his programming language [Logo](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo) contributed a great deal to the popularization of turtles in computer culture.
Turtle walks are also quite popular in digital image processing where they are more commonly known as [Chain Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_code) or Freeman code.


#### Code Walks ####

The general idea is to assign a walking direction to each symbol of an alphabet and then read any code as a sequence of walking instructions, resulting in a trace that immediately exposes the stucture of the code in a visual manner.

This approach seems to have been discovered independently by several people.

#### Number Walks ####

This picture shows the [first turtlewalk](https://archive.org/stream/logicofchance029416mbp#page/n153/mode/1up) that I'm aware of.
It was published by John Venn in "The Logic of Chance" in 1888.

More recently this kind of Math Visualization has been extended to quite a few more digits of Pi and other numbers, the results of which you can see on the project page titled [Walking on Real Numbers](http://walks.carma.newcastle.edu.au/).
