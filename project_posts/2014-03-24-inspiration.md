## Meandering Music ##

**It would make a lot of sense to complement the installation by a sonic layer.**

Last year I met [Alex McLean](http://yaxu.org/) when I took part in his workshop called [Drawing, Weaving, and Speaking Live Generative Music](http://yaxu.org/workshop-drawing-weaving-and-speaking-live-generative-music/).

Alex demonstrated a Processing sketch where he was folding patterns of sound into a space filling curve. I'll reference his sketch here if I can find it. (It does not seem to be in [Yaxu's Github](https://github.com/yaxu/))

## Meandering Dance and Craft ##

#### Ringhom's Labyrinth Dances ####

A very interesting theory Lars-Ivar Ringhom in 1938, postulates that labyrinths were used for folk dances, that are very much like the Maypole Dances popular in Sweden:

While Ringholm's theory is refuted by labyrinth scientists, for the lack of historical evindence, this is still an incredibly interesting approach to labyrinth traces, and it immediately raises the question, as to what kinds of braids could be generated from the paths layed down in labyrinths!

I think it is notewory that actual braids only emerge if the paths of the braids (and hence the labyrinth) are crossing each other. So the Labyrinth depicted by Ringhom will not result in a braid, but Labyrinths with cross sections and loops certainly will.

#### Noemi Speiser's Braiding Track-Diagrams ####

An illustration of an actual maypole dance:

Below two illustrations by Noemi Speiser showing the abstract notation for braiding track-plans she developed in *"The Manual of Braiding"*.
